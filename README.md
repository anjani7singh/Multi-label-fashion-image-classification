# Multi-label-fashion-image-classification
In the Multi-label image classification the output is more than one classes rather than one of the classes. In my problem I have images of e-commerce website clothes images, each image belong to more than one category.
To solve above problem a CNN is designed with a modification that is output activation is sigmoid, and due that it works simmilar to one vs rest classification strategy.
